            <h1>Six Sigma Methodology</h1>

            <hr />

            Six sigma process was initially developed by Motorola in 1986, originally a 
	tool for process improvement. It was made famous by Jack Welsh who 
	introduced it as a key business strategy for General Electric in 1995 
	and it took the name of Six Sigma process.<br> 
	
	"Six sigma is a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for 
	eliminating defects (driving towards six standard deviations between the
	mean and the nearest specification limit) in any process - 
	from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service" 
	[<a> http://www.isixsigma.com/new-to-six-sigma/getting-started/what-six-sigma/</a>]<p>
	In this case of a PCB fabrication company, this will lead to an increase 
	in the manufacturability of the product, PCBs.<p> 
	
	Definition of defect: A defect is any variation of a required characteristic
	of the product or its parts, which is far enough removed from its nominal 
	value to prevent the product from fulfilling the physical and functional 
	requirements of the customer.<p>
	
	There are six steps which can be implemented to put the six sigma method 
	into practice, to improve the quality of a product, reduce the defects and 
	increase the manufacturablity of a product, a six sigma process can be utilised.
	This can be broken down into six steps.<p>
	
	Six Steps of Six Sigma:<br>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Identify the product characteristics that are critical to satisfying 
	both the physical and functional requirements of the customer and the 
	requirements of relevant regulatory agencies.</li>
	<li>Determine the specific product elements that contribute to 
	achieving these critical characteristics.</li>
	<li>According to product elements, determine the process step or 
	process choice that controls each critical characteristic.</li>
	<li>Determine a nominal design value and the maximum (real) 
	allowable tolerance for each critical characteristic that 
	still guarantees successful required performance.</li>
	<li>Determine the capability for parts and process elements 
	that control critical characteristics.</li>
	<li>If the Capability Index Cp is not &ge; 2 (Cpk &ge; 1.5), 
	then changes the design of the product and/or process to achieve Cp
	&ge; 2 (or institute process control measures that will narrow process 
	capability sufficiently to achieve Cp &ge; 2).</li>
	</ol>
	
	Where Cp is the process capability, this is covered in greater detail 
	<a href = "url"> here</a>.
	It can be defined as the full range of normal process variation observed 
	for a given characteristic curve:<br>
	
	<figure>
	<img src="bell curve.png" height="350" width="500">
	<figcaption> <i>FigX. - A normal dirtribution describing the outputs of a 
	certain characteristic of a product, taken from a sample. <br>It shows the 
	varition of the samples outputs and where the majority of the 
	characteristics values lie.</i>  
	</figcaption>
	</figure><p>
	
	In a six sigma process, it is desired for at least 99.74% of the normal 
	distribution to lie within the &plusmn;3&sigma;. Hence the name of six 
	sigma arises as the process is within the 6 &sigma; -where &sigma; is the 
	processes standard deviation.<br>
	Through out the manufacturing process, a target value is set for a product 
	specification. This applies for a multi-step or single step manufacture 
	process, the ideal product characteristic is defined as a desired functional
	output which is defined in the initial design. <br>
	 
	During the manufacture process the target characteristic variation of 
	products is the mean, as seen in the figure above. All the other variation 
	should be within the tolerance limits. Limits which still allow for 
	sufficient functionality. This includes a upper spec limit (USL) and a 
	lower spec limit (LSL). These limits are set in the design. If the 
	characteristics is out with the limits, it is considered to be non-functional.<p>
	
	It is important to note that an unrealistic tight design tolerances, 
	tighter than the customer requires, leads to the creation of defects.<p> 
	
	However, there are effective methods to measure defects within the product.
	  
	<ul>
	<li> Define and categories defects. </li>
	<li> Illustrate that most manufacturing processes have a normal distribution
	- 99% of the output products are with in a range of &plusmn;3&sigma;. 
	Where &sigma; is the standard deviation of the process.  </li>
	<li> Cp and Cpk are essential measures of the product and the process design
	- it defines th correlation of spec and process capability(Cp).</li>
	<li> Cp and Cpk allow to predict the probable occurrence of random defects. </li>
	</ul>
	
	The definition of a defect is described above and this leads onto the 
	requirement to define the characteristics of products. These are:
	
	<ul>
	<li>Variable: physical, measurable product characteristic.</li>
	<li>Attribute: The comparison of a characteristic to a standard - judged 
	good or bad (0 or 1). Eg. switch on or not. The standards can be set down 
	the manufacturer or by a governing body.</li>
	</ul>
	
	The variation of variable product characteristics can be defined as:
	
	<ul>
	<li> Variable characteristics are specified by designers as a nominal value
	 (target) with a tolerance about the target (variability). </li>
	<li> Manufacturing processes attempt to produce everything at the target 
	value.</li>
	<li> Imperfect process lead to variation in the desired 
	characteristic. </li>
	<li> When depicting as a frequency histogram, this type of variation
	 approximates a nominal distribution. </li>
	<li> This holds true for the majority of process characteristics.</li>
	<li> Standard deviation (&sigma;) - The standard deviation is a measure of 
	dispersion or variability which quantifies values which lie outwith the 
	population mean (when only a sample of the population is being described, 
	standard deviation is more properly denoted by s).</li>
	</ul>
	
	Here is a graphical representation of the normal distribution curve. The 
	frequency of a process occuring and as this is a six sigma process
	each interval on the process characteristic axis is a measurement of 
	standard deviation(&sigma;)<p>
	
	<figure> 
	<img src="Bell curve2.png" height="350" width="500"/>
	<figcaption> <i>FigX. - A normal dirtribution describing the outputs of a 
	certain characteristic of a product, taken from a sample.<br>It shows the 
	varition target value, mean (&micro;) and the standard deviation (&sigma;)
	of the process.</i>  
	</figcaption>
	</figure><p>
	
	Z-Tables which is a method used to allow the identification of the 
	probability that a variation will deviate from the nominal value. 
	This applies for any specific value (Z), the area under the curve with 
	a higher variation of Z is equal to the probability that a randomly 
	selected member of the population (X) will be equal to or greater than Z.
	 Z is simply defined as the number of standard deviation elements from the
	mean of the normal distribution and can be defined as:<br>
	
	<figure> 
	<p><MATH>Z = (X+&micro;)/<inline-block>&sigma; </MATH>
	<figcaption> <i> Equationx - The occurance of the of a value given the
	 target value and the standard deviation</i>
	</figcaption>
	</figure><p>
	
	Therefore, the probability that a value (Z) will be greater than or equal to
	the value can be seen in the shaeded area of fig above. A link to z tables
	is: <a> http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~athienit/Tables/Ztable.pdf </a>
	
	<figure>
	<img src="BellCurve_Z.png" height="350" width="500"/><br>
	<figcaption>
	<i> FigX - This figure shows the normal distribution curve, the shaded area
	is the probability that the value will lie within this region </i>
	</figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	A similar <b>process</b> applies to the symmetrical opposite of the normal 
	curve. -Z is equal to the probability that a randomly selected member of the
	population (X) will be equal to or less than -Z.<p>
	
	This progresses to the manufacture process capability definition:<p>
	
	Defined as the full range of the normal process variation observed 
	for a given characteristic.
	There are tolerances in every process, which give an upper and lower limit. 
	To be in specification, it requires to define what is out with these limits and 
	if out of these limits, the products are defective.<p>
	
	Cp is a measure of how capable the process is of producing the required 
	process characteristic, Process capability is defined as being between 
	&plusmn;3&sigma;, i.e. 6&sigma;. This is not to be confused with a 6&sigma;
	 process.<p> 
	 
	Cp is the design margin : Cp=  (USL-LSL)/6&sigma; (where USL and LSL are
	upper and lower spec limits.)<p>
	
	However, this does not account for a shift in the mean value.
	The actual performance of the process - 
	Cpk: Cpk=  ((min(USL-X<sup>-</sup> ),X<sup>-</sup>-USL))/3&sigma;<p>
	
	Realized mean into account Cpk = Cp when the process mean is equal to 
	nominal value. This takes into consideration the process mean not hitting 
	the target value.<p>
	
	Therefore: Cpk = Cp(1-K) where K = |Nominal - process mean|/0.5(USL-LSL).<p>
	
	The maximization of Cp requires the joint and concurrent effort of both
	product and process designers. Product design has the goal of increasing the
	allowable tolerance to the maximum which will still permit successful 
	function of the product. Process design has the goal of minimizing the 
	variability of the process which reproduces the characteristic required for 
	successful function of the product, and for centering the process on target
	(nominal) value of the characteristic. A high Cp index indicates that the 
	process is capable of reproducing the characteristic. (It makes no
	statement about the centering of the process). A high Cpk index indicates
	that the process is actually reproducing the characteristic within the 
	desired limits. (It makes no statement about the inherent capability, 
	other than its minimum value).<p>
	A six sigma processes will have 3.4 defects per million (dependednt on the 
	number of parts), if it has a high capability index. A very accurate process.<p>
	
	<img src="TableJpeg.jpg" height="300" width="530"><p>
	
	This allows for a to define a process which is has the ability to 
	characterize the ability of the process, to evaluate whether the process 
	is sufficiently meeting the requirements.<p>
	
	This leads on to the parameter, yield: The number of useable products 
	after the manufacture process.<br>
	
	A highly manufacturable product exhibits very high yield in the factory, 
	whereas a poorly manufacturable product does not.<p>
	There are a number of definition of yield as can be seen in the equations 
	below:<p>
	
	<img src="Yield.png" height="250" width="400"/><p>
	
	The most useful yield is Rolled Yield- the number of useable products 
	relative to the number of products processed.<p>
	
	And First Time Yield - What percentage of the products 
	manufactured are useable first time round.<br>
	
	It is possible to detect a defect and repair it or scrap it. The yield in 
	repairable and non-repairable products are:<br>
	
	<ul>
	<li> Process yield for repairable product is virtually 100% - one unit 
	completed for each unit started.</li>
	<li> For non-repairable product, process yield may be significantly less 
	then 100%, because of units declared unusable and scrapped. </li>
	<li> Rolled yield - proportion of product that goes through entire process 
	defect-free - is essentially the same as process yield for non-repairable 
	product. </li>
	<li> For repairable product, rolled yield may be significantly lower than 
	process yield.</li>
	</ul><br>
	
	A more universal measurement is needed to measure the yield and is more
	practical, there are 2 types of distribution: Uniform distribution and 
	random distribution. Uniform being - same defect occurs in every unit of a batch
	and random being - probability of failure to random units.<br>
	
	Measurement of defects for attribute type data is defects per unit, 
	which can relate over a range, even if 1 in a million.<br> 
	
	<img src="dpu.png" height="70" width="250"/><p>
	
	This can apply to both single and multi-step processes.<br>
	
	There are probability distributions which produce the probability of a 
	defective product or process.<br>
	
	Poisson's formula describes an event happening in both time and space.
	This is the poisson distribution:<br>
	
	Poisson describes the probability distribution of an event occurring with 
	respect to time or space.<br>
	
	More formally and mathematically:<br>
	
	<img src="poisson.png" height="70" width="150"/> <br>
	
	X - the number of events in a given time interval<br>
	
	&micro; - the mean event during the time interval<p>
	
	Poisson can be described in a defect per unit form:<br>
	
	<img src="poisson2.png" height="75" width="175"/>
	
	<br> This gives the probability that a value has a defect, for example, 
	if dpu of 1. There will be a probability of 36.78% that a product will
	have a defect of some kind.<p>
	
	Therefore, FTY in terms of dpu is FTY = e<sup>-dpu</sup><p>
	
	The probability of no defects can be given by the FTY equation. 
	Poission formula also predicts the probability that a product that
	will have x defects in the manufacture process. Therefore, makes it possible
	to calculate the distribution.<br>
	
	An example could be:<br>
	
	1000 DRAM chips are known to contain 500 defects. The dpu is 500/1000 = 0.5.
	To find the defect per unit (dpu), it is important to split it into how 
	many DRAM chips will have x defects. This can range from 0 to 7.<br> 
	 
	Using the equation for the probability with dpu above it is possible to 
	calculate the probability of the percentage will have that number of defects.<br>
	
	eg. For a DRAM device to have 3 defects: P{3} = 0.5<sup>3</sup>e<sup>-0.5</sup>/3!. 
	This equals 0.0126 (1.26%). Out of 1000 unit, 13 units will have 3 defects.
	Therefore, 39 defects in total.<br>
	 
	This can be carried out for each defect value, from 0 to 7 and a 
	distribution formed.<br>
	
	To calculate the first time yield, the fabrication process is tested. 
	the probability of it going through the entire fabrication process without 
	a defect is simply the joint probability of the product passing all tests 
	and inspections without a defect. 
	In a multi-step process: P{A}xP{B}xP{C} = e<sup>-a</sup>xe<sup>-b</sup>xe
	<sup>-c</sup><br>
	
	Where a,b and c are values of dpu.<br>
	
	The poisson distribution for the whole process is: P{process} = e<sup>-
	(a+b+c)</sup><br>
	
	This is through exponentional multiplication<br>
	
	By adding a the dpu levels this would give a rolled yield and not dependent
	on the order of the process flow.
	To normalise products with different number of parts, part per million is 
	used: ppm/part = 1000000 x dpu/parts count<p>
	
	Bench marking is used to evaluate a process. The following steps are 
	required:<br>
	
	<ol>
	<li> <strong>Determine the number of opportunities for error.</strong> 
	For product, the number of opportunities for error is considered to be 
	the total parts count. For other than product, consider the number of 
	elements which go into the finished work (the number of fields in a data 
	form, number of words on a page, number of operations performed, etc.)</li>	 
	<li> <strong>Measure the total defects per unit.</strong> For product, this
	is measured in the factory.  For other than product, a measurement equivalent
	to total defects per unit is needed. This may be derived from: First-time 
	yield (FTY) or dpu = -ln (FTY)</li>
	<li> <strong>Calculate ppm per part.</strong> Ppm/part = 1000000 x dpu / 
	parts count</li>
	<li> <strong>Estimate process capability.</strong> Determine sigma using 
	chart</li><p> 
	The increase in the capability of a process by optimising the steps 
	above. Results in the FTY, which has an output of one of these:<p>
	
	<img src="yieldpercent.png" height="50%" width="50%"/><p>
	
	It can be seen that a highly capable process results in a much higher FTY, 
	also extending to a high complexity.<br>
	Also a highly capable process (C<sub>p</sub> = 2.0) there is a very high 
	yield for products up to 17000 parts but quickly declines after. 
	Therefore, this is the process which is sought after.<br>
	
	Here is a comparison of a 6&sigma; and a 4&sigma; process:<br>
	
	<img src="comp.png" height=height="350" width="500"/><p> 
	
	A much larger output is possible from this process, as the limits are 
	further from the target mean. Also, if a shift in the target value occurs;
	a process which lies within spec, can contian defects:<p>
	
	<img src="Shift.png" height=height="350" width="500"/><p>
	
	This is a 4&sigma; process, if this is compared to a 6&sigma; process, the 
	shift in target value due to an external effect, does not cause the process 
	to be out of spec.<p>
	
	<img src="Shift6.png" height="225" width="500"/><p>
	
	This is a far superior process and the time and money invested in the 
	possibility of this process results in a much more cost effective manufacture 
	procedure with a higher yield.
	
	<h2>Relationship between Reliability and Quality</h2>
	"Engineering reliability typically refers to the probability that a system, 
	or any of its components, will perform a required function for a stated 
	period of time and under specified operating conditions. As such, 
	reliability is inextricably linked with time-dependent quality concepts, 
	such as maintaining a state of control and predicting the chances of losses 
	from failures for quality risk management. Two popular current good 
	manufacturing practice (cGMP) and quality risk management tools, failure 
	mode and effects analysis (FMEA) and root cause analysis (RCA) are examples 
	of engineering reliability evaluations that link reliability with quality 
	and risk. Current concepts in pharmaceutical quality and quality management 
	systems call for more predictive systems for maintaining quality; yet, the 
	current pharmaceutical manufacturing literature and guidelines are curiously 
	silent on engineering quality. This commentary discusses the meaning of 
	engineering reliability while linking the concept to quality systems and 
	quality risk management. The essay also discusses the difference between 
	engineering reliability and statistical (assay) reliability." - 
	[http://journal.pda.org/content/66/6/512.abstract]<p>
	
	The improved reliability of a product, commonly  links to the customers 
	perception of 'quaility', the more it performs the desired output the 
	closer it is to the described product sold to the customer.<p>
	
	Reliabilty extends past the output of the products and can cover the 
	manufacturing process and the materials used.<p>
	
	The consistancy of a manufacturing process is important not cause much 
	variability between products. The reliabilty of the process and the 
	checks in the production line will ultimately result in a relable product.<p>
	
	The reliabilty of consistant materials will also lead to little variability 
	in the products. Whether the material is out sourced, which include a 
	relaible procurement, or from an interal source. The less defects the material 
	has, the more reliable it is and the smaller defects between products.
	Hence, the better quality as expressed above.<p>
	
	There are practices which can be carried out to ensure quality:<p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>cGMP - This mainly extends to food</li>
	<li>FMEA - This is covered in greater detail 
	<a href = "http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/process-analysis-tools/overview/fmea.html"> 
	here</a></li>
	<li>RCA - Root cause analysis is a method of problem solving that 
	tries to identify the root causes of faults or problems. A root cause is a 
	cause that once removed from the problem fault sequence, prevents the 
	final undesirable event from recurring. - More detail
