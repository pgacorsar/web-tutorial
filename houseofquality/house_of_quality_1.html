            <h1>House of Quality</h1>
			
			<p>
			Every successful company has always used data and information to 
			help in its planning processes. In
			planning a new product, engineers have always examined the 
			manufacturing and performance history of the
			current product. They look at field test data, comparing their 
			product to that of their competitor’s product.
			They examine any customer satisfaction information that might 
			happen to be available. Unfortunately,
			much of this information is often incomplete. It is frequently 
			examined as individual data, without
			comparison to other data that may support or contradict it.[1]
			</p>
			
			<p>
			By contrast, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) uses a matrix format 
			to capture a number of issues that
			are vital to the planning process. The House of Quality Matrix is 
			the most recognized and widely used
  			form of this method. It translates customer requirements, based on 
			marketing research and benchmarking
			data, into an appropriate number of engineering targets to be met 
			by a new product design. Basically, it is
			the nerve center and the engine that drives the entire QFD process. 
			According to Hauser and Clausing, it is
			“a kind of conceptual map that provides the means for 
			interfunctional planning and communication.”
			</p>
			
			<p>
			There are many different forms of the House of Quality, but its 
			ability to be adapted to the requirements of a
			particular problem make it a very strong and reliable system to use.
			Its general format is made up of six
			major components. These include customer requirements, technical 
			requirements, a planning matrix, an
			interrelationship matrix, a technical correlation matrix, and a 
			technical priorities/benchmarks and targets
			section.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Here is a diagram of a house of quality:

			<p>
			This method uses the following steps to build up a representation 
			of the method<br>
			</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li> Voice of Customer.</li>
			<li> Translating for action</li>
			<li> Extent of product</li>
			<li> Correlation matrix</li>
			<li> Importance rating</li>
			<li> Assessments</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>Voice of Customer</h5>
			<p>
			The initial customer requirements are formed. What the customer 
			requires is thoughtout. The items are usually general and vague.
			The customer will not pick up on some requirements. For example,
			'good ride' of a car. So these requirements are assumed and 
			included in	the overall requirements. It is possible to structure 
			this is to 3 levels: Primary, Secondary and tertiary requirements. 
			On importance to the customer.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The initial steps in forming the House of Quality include 
			determining, clarifying, and specifying the
			customers’ needs. These steps lay the foundation for a 
			clearly defined venture and will ensure a project or
			process is well thought out prior to any further development.
			Clarifying Customer Needs
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Customers buy benefits and producers offer features. This seems like
			a relatively simple notion, however,
			unless customers and producers are perfectly in tune with one 
			another, it may be very difficult to anticipate
			these features, or each underlying benefit from each producer. 
			It is of utter importance to translate the
			wishes of each and every customer into some tangible values that 
			can be turned into engineering
			specifications. Some of theses features include but are not limited 
			to:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Parts</li>
			<li>Costs</li>
			<li>Functions</li>
			<li>Quality Character& Reliability</li>
			<li>Processes</li>
			<li>Tasks</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			<b>Specifying the Customer Needs</b>
			After determining what items are most important to the customer, 
			organizations must translate them into
			particulate specifications. Nothing can be produced, serviced or 
			maintained without detailed specifications
			or some set of given standards. Each aspect of the desired item must
			be clearly defined: Measurements must be defined, heights specified, 
			torques stated, and weights targeted.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			These values can be derived from several locations. Organizations 
			can use known data from market
			research, or conduct new studies to gather necessary information. 
			In any event, the needs, which were
			clarified and then explicitly stated, should be satisfied to the 
			best of that organization’s ability.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Translating for Action</h5>
			<p>
			Once the list of what the requirements are developed, these
			require further definition. This is achieved by listing how these
			requirements are to be implemented. This is a technical translation.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The implementation of the requirements should be functional rather 
			than specific solutions which stifle innovation. Should be 
			measurable which allow the product to be evaluated once built.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Matrix Correlation</h5>
			<p>
			A matrix correlation can be implemented to determine the strength 
			of the relationship. How important is it to what it is.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b>Planning the Matrix</b><br>
			The next step in the QFD process is forming a planning matrix.
			The main purpose of the planning matrix is
			to compare how well the team met the customer requirements 
			compared to its competitors. The planning
			matrix shows the weighted importance of each requirement that 
			the team and its competitors are attempting
			to fulfill. Customer ratings, typically ranging from 1 to 5, are 
			given to each company under each
			requirement. The customer ratings are combined with the weighted 
			performance of each demand to
			produce an overall performance measure for the companies. The 
			planning matrix is a part of the “House of
			Quality” matrix.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Interrelationship Matrix</h5>
			<p>
			The main function of the interrelationship matrix is to establish a
			connection between the customer’s
			product requirements and the performance measures designed to 
			improve the product. The first step in
			constructing this matrix involves obtaining the opinions of the 
			consumers as far as what they need and
			require from a specific product. These views are drawn from the 
			planning matrix and placed on the left side
			of the interrelationship matrix.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			With this customer overview, the company can begin to formulate a 
			strategy to improve their product. In
			doing this, the strengths and weaknesses of the company are 
			weighted against the customer priorities to
			determine what aspects need to be changed to surpass the 
			competition, what aspects need to change to equal
			the competition, and what aspects will be left unchanged. The 
			optimal combination is desired.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Knowing what improvements need to be made allows the list of 
			performance measures to be generated and
			displayed across the top of the interrelationship matrix. By 
			definition, a performance measure is a technical
			measure evaluating the product’s performance of a demanded 
			quality (Terninco). In other words, the
			company must take the voice of the customer and translate it into 
			engineering terms. The matrix will have
			at least one performance measure for each demanded quality.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			After setting up the basic matrix, it is necessary to assign 
			relationships between the customer requirements
			and the performance measures. These relationships are portrayed by 
			symbols indicating a strong
			relationship, a medium relationship, or a weak relationship. The 
			symbols in turn are assigned respective
			indexes such as 9-3-1, 4-2-1, or 5-3-1. When no relationship is 
			evident between a pair a zero value is
			always assigned. The interrelationship matrix should follow the 
			Pareto Principle keeping in mind that
			designing to the critical 20% will satisfy 80% of the customer 
			desires (Terninco). Therefore, there should
			not be a significant number of strong relationships between pairs.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Technical Correlation Matrix</h5>
			<p>
			Performance measures in existing designs often conflict with each 
			other. The technical correlation matrix,
			which is more often referred to as the Roof, is used to aid in 
			developing relationships between customer
			requirements and product requirements and identifies where these 
			units must work together otherwise they
			will be in a design conflict. The following symbols are used to 
			represent what type of impact each
			requirement has on the other.
			</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li> Strong Positive</li>
			<li> Positive</li>
			<li> Negative</li>
			<li> Strong Negative</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			These symbols are then entered into the cells where a correlation 
			has been identified. The objective is to
			highlight any requirements that might be in conflict with each other
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Any cell identified with a high correlation is a strong signal to 
			the team, and especially to the engineers, that
			significant communication and coordination are a must if any 
			changes are going to be made. If there is a
			negative or strongly negative impact between requirements, the 
			design must be compromised unless the
			negative impact can be designed out. Some conflicts can’t be 
			resolved because they are an issue of physics.
			Others can be design-related, which leaves it up to the team to 
			decide how to resolve them. Negative
			impacts can also represent constraints, which may be bi-directional.
			As a result, improving one of them
			may actually cause a negative impact to the other. Sometimes an 
			identified change impairs so many others
			that it is just simply better to leave it alone. According to 
			Step-By-Step QFD by John Terninko, asking the
			following question when working with this part of the House of 
			Quality helps to clarify the relationships
			among requirements: “If technical requirement X is improved, will 
			it help or hinder technical requirement
			Z?”
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Many technical requirements are related to each other so working 
			to improve one may help a related
			requirement and a positive or beneficial effect can result. On the
			other hand,	working to improve one
			requirement may negatively affect a related requirement as 
			mentioned above. One of the principal benefits
			of the Roof is that it flags these negative relationships so they 
			can be resolved. If these issues aren’t settled
			satisfactorily, some aspects of the final product will dissatisfy 
			the customer.
			</p>
			
			<h5>Conclusion</h5>
			<p>
			The House of Quality functions as a living document and a source 
			of ready reference for related products
			and future upgrades. While it is a great communication tool at each 
			step in the process, the matrices are the
			means and not the end. Its purpose is to serve as a vehicle for 
			dialogue to strengthen vertical and horizontal
			communications.
			</p>
			S
			<p>
			Through customer needs and competitive analysis, the House of 
			Quality helps to identify the critical
			technical components that require change. Issues are addressed that
			may never have surfaced before.
			These critical issues are then driven through the other matrices to 
			identify the critical parts, manufacturing
			operations, and quality control measures needed to produce a 
			product that fulfills both customer needs and
			producer needs within a shorter development cycle time.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The net effect of all of this is that the items that drive the 
			company’s actions are driven by the customer’s
			requirements. There is an increased focus on the customer and an 
			increased awareness of their wants.
			Because of this focus, the process leads to improved customer 
			understanding and the ultimate outcome – a
			satisfied customer
